Dive into the depths of my digital workshop! A curious blend of humor, professionalism, and that undeniable tech geek essence, this space encapsulates my footprints in the coding sand. Enjoy the tour, and maybe pick up a line or two of code while you're at it!

## üõ† Toolbox

| Gadget          | Why I Use It                                                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Typescript**  | Keeping my code in check. After all, better safe than sorry!           |
| **Next.js**     | If JAMstack were a music genre, I'd have all its albums.               |
| **TailwindCSS** | Making things look sleek without breaking a sweat.                     |
| **Radix UI**    | My foundation. Everything starts from a good base, right?              |
| **CmdK**        | Efficiency in a press of keys. It's the future, today!                 |
| **Vercel**      | Where all my projects catch some Zs (and by Zs, I mean zero downtime). |
